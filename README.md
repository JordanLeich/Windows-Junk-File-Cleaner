# Description :open_file_folder:
- This is used as a python script that I use for my computer. This script is set to automatically run everyday at 1:30pm, once running the script will open a pre-installed cleaning program that is on every windows PC and then open two other junk folders inside of windows to clean up. You can also [visit](https://jordanleich.github.io/Junk-File-Cleaner/) my website for additional information.

# Important :zap:
1. You do not need python installed to be able to use my program! If you choose not to use python or don't have it installed, you can download the .exe installer and use that instead!
1. It is best to use and run this program or script as being an administrator since one to two of the junk folders will almost always contain administror controllered files and folders that need to be cleaned. Without being an administrator, the script will only partially clean junk files and will eventually hit an error that will end the script.

# [Requirements](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Junk-File-Cleaner/blob/master/requirements.txt) :exclamation:
1. Windows operating system
1. Colored (you can install colored by using pip install colored) (only applys to those who are using python and not the .exe installer!)
